Decrypt Chrome Cookies with OCaml
=================================

Evolved clone of [n8henrie](https://n8henrie.com/)'s [Chrome cookies extractor](https://n8henrie.com/2014/05/decrypt-chrome-cookies-with-python/).

Opens a Chromium sqlite3 cookies store, decrypts them, and creates a
netscape-style cookies.txt file (for youtube-dl, curl, etc).
